# Digital-signatures
Using rejection sampling theorem for bounded uniform distributed maksing vectors to adjust parameters in CRYSTALS-Dilithium to achieve better efficiency or smaller signature size. 

1. The signing efficiency of Dilithium_medium_variant1(this work I) is about 66% faster than that in Dilithium_medium(Dilithium_II);
2. The signing efficiency of Dilithium_recommended_variant(this work II) is about 48% faster than that in Dilithium_recommended(Dilithium_III);
3. The signing efficiency of Dilithium_very_high_variant(this work III) is about 24% faster than that in Dilithium_very_high(Dilithium_IV);
4. The signature size of Dilithium_medium_variant2(this work IV) is about 14% smaller than that in Dilithium_medium(Dilithium_II);

All comparisons are conducted under the same security levels.
